It's not pretty but it works.

It uses a helios logo in CSS just moving around the screen.

On a click the logo is hidden and the form is displayed.

After entering first, last and email a button is clicked to send to the url using fetch.

A global window.__URL__ object is created allowing anybody to change the URL in the console.

All the logic is in ./src/components/SimpleForm.vue
